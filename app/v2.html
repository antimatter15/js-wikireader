			If you're reading this source code, I urge you to visit js/highlyeffectivedrm.js
			
			And if you're reading this in the distant future, say, 2012, and you aren't preparing
			for the imminent apocalyptic scenarios (or if you are, that would be cool too), you 
			should totally email me at antimatter15@gmail.com.
			
			If you're reading this in the post-apocalyptic world, or if for some odd reason
			skynet was actually powered by Amazon EC2 during the great outage of April 21st,
			2011, and somehow the malfunctioning of the cloud resulted in the prolonging of 
			human existence, then you should still email me because there might be a decent
			chance that I would have survived the chaos which ensued during the eventless
			apocalypse.
			
			And in case the future me ever reads this. Hi. I'm you from the past. It would be
			pretty interesting to meet you. But regardless, I would probably be disappointed
			in whatever you've done because life seems to continue according to my diminishing
			intelligence hypothesis. Probably, you're at least thinking that you're a lot dumber
			than you were when I wrote this, and wondering why I consider myself a different person
			when existing in different times. However, the people who aren't me who might happen
			to read this document will probably find it really weird that some guy talks to himself
			about the future and past and is probably insane or suffering some odd self diagnosed
			inferiority complex instigated by the two time rejection from an unnamed institution
		  for people interested in science and technology. But saying that would make future me
		  feel weird as well as future non-mes.

			Offline Wiki is downloading a copy of the entirety of the English language wikipedia right now to your computer. Up above should be a progress bar indicating the progress of the download. Be warned that the sum of all human knowledge is not small (At time of writing, it is about 3.7 GB), and may take many hours to complete. 
			</p>
			<p>
			When you are offline, the downloaded state will be frozen to whatever you have already downloaded. The articles are downloaded alphabetically, and include nearly all articles. When you close this tab, the download will stop and resume when you open this app again.
			</p>
			<p>
			You can still search browse articles while the encyclopedia is downloading, but they are limited to those which have already been downlaoded.
