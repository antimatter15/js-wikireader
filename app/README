Hello. 


This is a readme file, and you would probably be somewhat annoyed
if this text document didn't document anything that might be somehow
important to the use of this project.

The fact it's in the source code means its probably not user facing.
Which means that this readme implies that you have some technical experience
with the command line and aren't afraid to open up a text editor (though you
probably won't need to).


Anyway, to create your own updated or dump for an alternate language:


1. Download a database dump: pages-articles.xml.bz2 should be the right one from http://dumps.wikimedia.org/backup-index.html

2. Unpack the bz2 compressed archives to pages-articles.xml

3. Open up a terminal and navigate to the tools directory of this folder

4. Make sure you have python 2.6 (other versions may work too) and pylzma 

5. Run python indexer.py < pages-articles.xml

6. Run python sort.py

7. Run python sorttext.py

8. The only important files are dump.index and dump.lzma, copy those to a web server

9. Modify manifest.json to include the <all_urls> permission instead of the google storage url.

	"permissions": [
    "unlimitedStorage",
    "<all_urls>"
  ]

10. Find the URL of the directory which contains dump.index and dump.lzma and paste it in the application when it asks for the URL
