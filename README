Creating a Formatted Wikipedia Dump (go to tools directory):

1. Download files from github
2. Install pylzma (easy_install pylzma; note that you need to have python-dev installed)
3. Download a Wikipedia dump (you should get pages-articles.xml.bz2) http://dumps.wikimedia.org/backup-index.html
4. bzcat enwiktionary-20110205-pages-articles.xml.bz2 | python index.py
5. python merge.py
6. Create a wikidata.txt file in the same directory
7. sh magic.sh
8. This will create an omni.dump file. That's your magical dump. Rename it to whatever you like and import it to wikireader.

Using JS-WikiReader:
1. On Chrome, just load the directory from chrome://extensions
2. On Firefox, open web.html and import the dump file

No idea why it's called carrot. I just saw this cool icon for a carrot on openclipart and thought, why not?
